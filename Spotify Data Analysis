# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


#First I showed songs and popularity only by The Weeknd 

SELECT 
track_name,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'The Weeknd'
;

#Next I listed artists and tracks with a popularity rating over 70 and danceability around 50% 

SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,popularity
,danceability
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
WHERE popularity > '70'
AND danceability like '%.5%'
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined the top 20 tracks by popularity

SELECT track_name
,artist_name
,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 20;

#Lastly I selcted the track that had the most energy

SELECT track_name
,artist_name
,energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 1;
